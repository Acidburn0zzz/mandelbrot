==== Introduction ====

This package contains two implementations of a graphical Mandelbrot set
explorer.

One, implemented in the racket language, was a first exploratory attempt. It is
simple, but reasonably functional.

The other, implemented in C, aims at doing the same thing as the racket
version, but more efficiently. It is a work in progress, so while it is already
faster, it isn't yet as nice to use as the racket version, in that it doesn't
include progressive rendering, and gives no feedback of what's going on while
it renders the set for a given zoom level.


==== Installation ====

To build this package, run this command:
  ./configure && make

If you checked it out of the source code repository directly, instead of in a
packaged tarball, you'll need to run this instead:
  autoreconf && ./configure && make

To install the C version only, run:
  make install

For the Racket version, run:
  make instal_proto

For both version, run:
  make install_with_proto

The C version depends on GTK2, and the racket version needs racket (or
gracket, to be specific).


==== Usage ====

Both versions have the same interface. Simply start the program by typing its
name (mandlebrot for the C version, mandelbrot.rkt for the racket version), and
you'll be presented with a rendering of the Mandelbrot set.

Left click anywhere to zoom in.

Right click to increase the maximum number of iterations used. Doing so slows
back the rendering, but as you zoom in, you need to do it to get additional
details.
